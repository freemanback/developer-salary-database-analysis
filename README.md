# Developer Salary Analysis: Influence of Database Skills

This project analyzes how a developer’s experience with different database technologies influences their yearly compensation, based on the 2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey.  The Medium Blog post can be found here (https://medium.com/@freemanback17/do-database-skills-really-pay-off-3ed6f9ffff10).

Followed CRISP-DM methodology for the project:
1. **Business Understanding** – Explore whether database skills are predictive of developer salaries.
2. **Data Understanding** – Use survey data and understand its schema.
3. **Data Preparation** – Clean and transform the data, especially the `DatabaseHaveWorkedWith` column.
4. **Modeling** – Train a linear regression model to predict salary from database usage.
5. **Evaluation** – Evaluate performance using R² and MSE.
6. **Deployment** – Present findings in an annotated Jupyter Notebook.


## Project Goals

  Determine which databases correlate with higher compensation.
  Visualize salary distribution by database technology.
  Predict salary using a machine learning model.
  Interpret model results with coefficients.


## Technologies Used

- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Stack Overflow Survey 2024**


## Files

- `Developer_Salary_Database_Analysis.ipynb`: Main notebook with code, visualizations, and model.
- `survey_results_public.csv`: Raw survey data from Stack Overflow.
- `survey_results_schema.csv`: Schema file explaining each column.

## Visuals


## The notebook includes:

- Distribution plot of yearly salary
- Bar plot of median salary by database
- Box plot of salary ranges for top databases
- Coefficient plots from the regression model


## Model

We train a **linear regression model** using one-hot encoded database usage features. The model attempts to predict developer compensation based solely on database experience. The results are evaluated using:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R² Score**


## Conclusion

- Databases like **Redis**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Microsoft SQL Server** are associated with **higher compensation**.
- Database experience alone explains only part of salary variation. 
- Future iterations can incorporate other predictors like job title, education, experience, and location.


## Acknowlegments
Big thanks to [Stack Overflow](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/) for releasing this awesome data each year.
